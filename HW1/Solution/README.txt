Since this projected is implemented on Google Colab, there is no additional default value or terminal command that need to be entered. One can simply run this .ipynb file on their Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab. One catch is, the necessary csv files are read directly from the project structure, therefore the person must have the necessary files added to the project folder, in order to successfully be able to read them.
